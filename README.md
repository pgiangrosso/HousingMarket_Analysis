# HousingMarket_Analysis
Within Jacksonville, FL from FEB. 2018 - FEB.2023

## There were 3 objectives for this project:
1. Collect a unique dataset and display an understanding of data collection and **cleaning**. 
2. Display an understanding of how to use **PostgreSQL**
3. Discover insights from the dataset and illustrate some of these using **Tableau**

_This data is only a shallow dive into the area's housing market dynamics from the past 5 years. Not a deep dive. Regardless, with the data, we can still see some trends present._

The data collected was taken from Redfin's website. It specifically was filtered out for homes with 2-4 bedrooms around Jacksonville, Florida.
